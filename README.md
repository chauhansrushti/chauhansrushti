## Hi there, I am Srushti👋
Aspiring | Tech Explorer | Problem Solver | 💻 IT Student✨

🔭 Currently exploring the world of **Web Development**, **APIs**, and **IoT**.  

🌱 Every day, I’m trying to turn “why doesn’t this work?” into “ohh… that’s why!” moments.  

🧩 I believe good code isn’t written — it’s **debugged into existence**.  

💬 Let’s connect — always open to learning and collaborating on cool projects!  
I’m an IT student with a big dream — to understand computers so well that they finally start understanding me back. I love building things that make life easier, from simple websites to complex systems. I’m currently exploring Data Analysis, Advanced React.js, and more.. I believe that technology has the power to change the world, just some prompts and project is ready, and I want to be part of that change — one project at a time.<!--
