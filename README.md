## Hi there, I am Srushti👋
Aspiring | Tech Explorer | Problem Solver | 💻 IT Student✨

🔭 Currently exploring the world of **Web Development**, **APIs**, and **IoT**.  

🌱 Every day, I’m trying to turn “why doesn’t this work?” into “ohh… that’s why!” moments.  

🧩 I believe good code isn’t written — it’s **debugged into existence**.  

💬 Let’s connect — always open to learning and collaborating on cool projects!  
I’m an IT student with a big dream — to understand computers so well that they finally start understanding me back. I love building things that make life easier, from simple websites to complex systems. I’m currently exploring Java, React.js, and  while learning how to write cleaner, smarter, and more efficient code. Coding for me is like solving puzzles — frustrating at first, but incredibly satisfying when everything finally clicks. I believe that technology has the power to change the world, and I want to be part of that change — one project at a time.<!--
